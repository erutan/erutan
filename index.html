      <h1>welcome to erutan.net</h1>
      
      <p>back to the hustle, so why hire me?</p>
        
      <h2>a bit about me</h2>
        
      <p>I'm Carl Uebelhart and I've been front-endish since 1996 â€“ the glory days of Geocities. I'm one of those annoying folks that really cares about the semantic usage of HTML elements, and I build thoughtful reusable CSS (nothing quite like making some branding changes to a shared custom library, have multiple applications pull them in as a git submodule, and not spend much time cleaning up visual glitches). It's pretty common for me to swap between a few other hats on a gig: research and analysis, ux/persona development, information/site architecture, content strategy, copy writing, site configuration, and non-critical sysadmin.</p>
      
      <p>I personally find it much more interesting to be a jack of all trades, and it ends up fitting well into small teams. Often times there isn't a need to have a dedicated person for each role, and handling multiple roles ends up saving time, money, and decreases the chance of miscommunication. Once you're far enough (subjective) into a visual design you can switch to developing in browser vs creating yet more artifiacts to toss away at the end.</p>
        
      <h2>web application prototyping</h2>
    
      <p>I usually shift quickly into designing with code front-end prototyping once a general direction is set via graphical comps. The problems tend to be more intellectually stimulating, the technology cleaner, and the contracts less rushed than building yet another brochure site.</p>
      
      <p>Some examples of work for an internal team at UCLA are the UI for their <a href="https://github.com/ucla/SSOUI" target="_blank">Shibboleth Single Sign-On System</a> and the initial release of their <a href="https://github.com/ucla/SSOUI" target="_blank">online self-service management tool</a>.
      
      <h2>content management systems</h2>
      
      <p>I've been focusing on Drupal recently, while it's a little clunkier to theme than some of the other options, you can chain together modules to do some pretty powerful things relatively simply.  I was lead front-end developer for a redesign of <a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/">UCSF.edu</a> built on Drupal 7, have given community talks to Drupal groups in the Bay Area, and have done content strategy, migration, site-building, and theming for multiple smaller projects.</p>
      
      <p>On the other side of the spectrum, a lot of websites don't need the overhead of a modern database driven CMS. I've built out a Jekyll internal documentation system for <a href="https://looker.com/">Looker</a> and most of my own personal tinkering is in this space.</p>
  
      <h2>photography</h2>
      
      <p>I pretty much just shoot with my iPhone XS (Halide + LR CC) but my Sony MIRC with a Zeiss 18mm and some nice vintage glass is still sitting around.</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/erutan/albums/72157637329701674" target="_blank">Landscape photography</a>: I've had landscape photos published in a few newspapers, magazines, and books, plus prints hung at event spaces around Santa Cruz.</li>
        
        <li><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/erutan/albums/72157637329727144" target="_blank">Client Photography</a>: Portraits taken for: Alex Cowan, Andrew Mueller, Demeter Pharmaceuticals, Satellite Inc, UCSF Podust Lab, and some other fine folk.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>contact</h2>
      
      <p>My email address is my first name, @ this domain. It's probably been scraped and in a ton of databases, but hey, gotta give the bots a run for their money. Not that active on social media these days, but I have a few repos on <a href="https:/github.com/erutan"> github</a>, have old camera photos on <a href="https:/www.flickr.com/erutan/sets">flickr</a>, more casual iPhone shots on <a href="https:/www.instagram.com/erutan">instagram</a> and pretty much just harass / interact with brands on <a href="https:/twitter.com/erutan">twitter</a>.
